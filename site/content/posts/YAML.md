## Creating a script to manage Git-Repositories

We had a course on bash-scripting and scripting in general, and I learned a lot from it. With the new-found knowledge I was able to write a number of new scripts.

### 1. Managing Unix Users
The first Script I wrote is able to create, delete and adjust Users and their setting depending on the input-file.
Inputs-files for the Script have to look something like this:
```sh
Username Group Password
```
I ran into quite a lot of issues, just because it was my first script and was supposed to be a training exercise
